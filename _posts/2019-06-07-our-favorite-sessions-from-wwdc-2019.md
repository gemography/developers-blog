Like every year, Apple's WWDC comes about and with it comes a plethora of new announcements and improvements across all platforms. This year was no exception. iOS got a new dark mode. macOS got a new name (and few improvements/features). We even got iPadOS now. 

But it's impossible to talk about WWDC 2019 without talking about Xcode 11 and SwiftUI. 

If you're like us and you enjoy WWDC sessions as much as the main keynote, we've compiled here a list of our favorite sessions from this year's WWDC:
