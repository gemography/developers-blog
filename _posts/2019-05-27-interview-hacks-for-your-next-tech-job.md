If you're interested in knowing more about what it takes not-to-bomb a tech interview. You've come to the right place.

I mean don't get me wrong, we've all been there. And it's probably part of the journey as a software engineer. Even the best engineers bombed one or two interviews at some point. Some of them even tweeted about it (i.e Jan Koum)

So yes, interviews are hard, but it doesn't have to be an emotional rollercoaster. And it doesn't have be an endless cycle of frustration.

But that's why we're here today, to (hopefully) do something about it. 

Based on our experience interviewing 1000+ engineers and collaborating with tech startups from all over the world, both small and large, we've compiled a list of common mistakes that engineers end up making, ways to avoid making them and what you can do instead to ace your next tech interview. 

Join us this **Saturday, June 1st 2019 at 4:30 PM (UTC)** for a discussion with United Remote Co-founder and VP of Engineering **Zack Braksa** around "Interview Hacks for Your Next Tech Job". 

This particular webinar is invite-only (sorry about that). But we really value having a conversation with all attendees, answer their questions and get to know their background.
